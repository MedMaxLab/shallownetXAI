### Results



## Provided code

Scripts used to generate the results presented in the paper are available in this repository.
In [AllFnc](https://github.com/MedMaxLab/shallownetXAI/tree/main/AllFnc) folder, 
the Python file **eegvislib.py** was developed with the intent to be used as library
for insepcting kernels and feature maps in DL applications, with a focus in EEG data.
The Jupyter Notebook *ModelVisualization.ipynb* shows a proof of concept of the usefulness.
In details, the library can help researchers to inspect both the weights and the feature maps,
learned by the neural network.
